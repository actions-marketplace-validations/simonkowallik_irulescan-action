## example

This folder contains example iRules and a YAML files used in the [example workflows](../.github/workflows/).

### iRules

The [`irules`](./irules) folder contains several iRules.

The iRule `irules/wrong_extension.txt` will not be scanned as the file extension neither matches `.tcl` nor `.irule`.

### YAML files

The file `expected_results.yaml` contains the expected output generated by a irulescan-action run with `scandir:` set to `example/`.

The file `results_dont_match.yaml` is incomplete and used to demo a non-expected result.
